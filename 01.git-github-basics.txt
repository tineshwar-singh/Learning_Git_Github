Git Install?
- You can download Git for free from the following website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Using Git with Command Line :-
- To start using Git, we are first going to open up our Command shell (Windows).
- For Windows, you can use Git bash, which comes included in Git for Windows. 
- For Mac and Linux you can use the built-in terminal.

Configure Git :-
- This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information
- When git is installed locally for the first time, we need to setup username and emailid by below commands
--> git config --global user.name "user_name"
--> git config --global user.email "user_email_id"

Initialize Git :-
- Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder by below command
--> git init 

Git Staging Environment :-
- Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:
--> Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
--> Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository
- When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked.
- To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.
- To add files in the staging area, you can use "git add file_name" or "git add ." commands

Git Commit :-
- Since we have finished our work, we are ready move from stage to commit for our repo.
- To create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history.

Git Branch :-
- Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch
- When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project
- You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other
